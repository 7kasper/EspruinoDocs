IoTKG is a free open access program that combines STEM and digital technologies education in the context of a school’s kitchen garden. Students study how to use objective data to improve sustainable gardening practices and how to automatically collect relevant data and control devices using Internet-of-Things (IoT) technology.  The course uses Espruino devices ([Puck.js](/Puck.js) and [Pixl.js](/Pixl.js)) as IoT data loggers and for embedded control tasks. The school’s kitchen garden provides an ideal micro-cosmos to develop these skills. In many ways, the students engage in a miniature version of sustainable Smart Agriculture.
