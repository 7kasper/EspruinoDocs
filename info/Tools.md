Tools and Supplies
================

* KEYWORDS: Tools,Supplies

**NOTE:** *We'll be fleshing this section out with more details as time goes on...*

If you're going to be making things with Espruino, some things are really handy:

## Tools

### Soldering Iron

A thin tip is useful. Generally speaking:

* Soldering irons with a separate power supply are going to be the best ones, but then they're also more expensive
* Soldering irons with a pistol-grip won't be good enough - you need one that you hold a bit like a massive pen

### Suldering Iron stand

Get one of these with a sponge in it. When wet, it can be used to get any oxidised solder off of the tip of the soldering iron, which makes soldering much easier.

### De-Solder Pump

Otherwise known as the Solder Sucker, it's a simple tool that simple sucks the molten solder off of joints. It's good to have one of these, because if you add too much solder you can easily remove it.

### Wire Strippers and Cutters

Don't be fooled by the huge semi-automatic wire strippers. Simple is better.

### Diagonal Cutters

Wire cutters with a simple cutting point - these are extremely useful for cutting wires close to the PCB

### Multimeter

Just a cheap volt meter with a continuity tester will be extremely useful.

### <a name="oscilloscope"></a>Oscilloscope

This is just a luxury unless you're routinely dealing with signals, but you may find that some simple hand-held oscilloscopes are very useful. On the cheaper end of things there's:

* Velleman [HPS140](http://www.hps140.com/)
* [DSO Nano](http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/dso-nano-v3-p-1358.html?cPath=63_65)
* [DSO Quad](http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/dso-quad-4-channel-digital-storage-oscilloscope-p-736.html?cPath=63_65)

While old-style analog Oscilloscopes are useful, Storage Oscilloscopes are massively more helpful for microcontrollers as you can record a non-repetitive signal and can then keep it displayed on the screen.

## Supplies

### Solder (ideally thinner than 1mm diameter)

Simple 'lead-free' solder. You definitely don't need Silver Solder.

### Multi-core wire

For wiring external parts to Espruino. Solid core wire is much more likely to break if it gets moved around a lot.

### Solid Core Wire

Just for wiring up parts that are soldered to your Espruino board. You can always use old Ethernet cable, but it's much better to have proper wire with insulation that is less likely to shrink when it gets hot.

### Flux

Nice to have - if you add a small amount of flux, the solder tends to pull itself together much more and you get a very clean joint. It's not a big deal for 0.1" soldering (most of what you'll do with Espruino) but if you're soldering surface mount components it's invaluable.

### De-soldering Braid

Again, nice to have for surface mount soldering, it 'wicks' the solder away from a joint and really cleans it up. If you have a solder sucker you'll probably never use this for 0.1" soldering though.
