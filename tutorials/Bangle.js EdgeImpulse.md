# Bangle_JS

**Introduction…**
-----------------

TBD

**Prerequisites**
-----------------

**Hardware**

* [Bangle JS, version 1](https://shop.espruino.com/banglejs) (v2 will be supported once it’s available)
  * Theoretically the Bangle Emulator might work as well, but you can’t of course collect real accelerometer or heart rate data with an emulator!
* Computer with Bluetooth (BLE)
* Get the watch up and running by following these [guidelines](https://banglejs.com/start)
… and connected by these [guidelines](https://www.espruino.com/Quick+Start+BLE#banglejs)


**Software**

* Create an Edge Impulse account for free [here](https://www.edgeimpulse.com/)
* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
   * used to split a file with samples into separate .CSV-files for importing into Edge Impulse
   * not strictly necessary, but very useful if you want to collect lots of samples
   * this tutorial will not cover how to install or use Python 
   * Notepad, Notepad++, Excel etc. can also be used, but needs manual work
