The Espruino Board supports the Texas Instruments CC3000 WiFi module. This allows you to connect to Wireless networks (and hence the internet).

**CC3000 support is not completely final yet, and as such the API may change slightly in the future**

First off, you need to connect the module. Currently it **must** be on the following pins:

|  CC3000  |  Espruino |
|----------|-----------|
| VCC/VIN  | VBAT      |
| GND      | GND       |
| CLK/SCK  | B3        |
| DOUT/MISO| B4        |
| DIN/MOSI | B5        |
| CS       | B6        |
| EN/VBEN  | B7        |
| IRQ      | B8        |


**Note:** VCC on the CC3000 needs to be between 2.7V and 4.8V. On the Espruino Board, VBAT is 4.3v when running from USB and is the same as the battery voltage when plugged into a battery. This means that when running with single-cell LiPo batteries you'll be fine, **HOWEVER** the situation may be different on other boards.

Using the CC3000 is as follows:

* Connect it as above CC3000
* Load the CC3000 module with ```require("CC3000").connect()```. This returns a ```WLAN``` object.
* Call ```connect``` on that object (see the example below), with a callback function
* In the callback function, respond to the ```dhcp``` message and use the ```http``` module to access the internet

**Note:** Calls to the CC3000 module may take a second or more to return at the moment. As the firmware and TI's library improve, hopefully this will reduce.

This example loads a webpage and prints the result:

```
var wlan = require("CC3000").connect();
wlan.connect( "AccessPointName", "WPA2key", function (s) { 
  if (s=="dhcp") {
    require("http").get("http://www.pur3.co.uk/hello.txt", function(res) {
      res.on('data', function(data) {
        console.log(">" + data);
      });
    });
  }
});

```

-----

At the moment the only CC3000 module that we know works for sure is the [AdaFruit CC3000](http://www.adafruit.com/products/1469) module, so we'd recommend that you get this from [AdaFruit](http://www.adafruit.com) or one of their distributors.

The [Embedded Adventures](http://www.embeddedadventures.com/cc3000_wifi_module_wrl-3000.html) module has been tested and **does not currently work with Espruino**. If you have success with it, please let us know!
