DS18B20 Temperature Sensor
=======================

* KEYWORDS: Module,OneWire,DS18B20,Temperature,Sensor

One of the most common 1-Wire devices is the DS18B20 thermometer. Use the [[DS18B20.js]] module for it.

To use it, connect the thermometer up - to 0v, 3.3v, and the data line to any free signal line of your Espruino device, with a 4.7k resistor between data and the 3.3v line. For this example I've chosen A1. 
 
Note: On the devices with cables, if you have Red, Yellow and Green wires then most likely they represent:

| Colour | Connection |
| ------ | ---------- |
| Green	 | Ground     |
| Red    | 3.3v       | 
| Yellow | Data       |

However please check the datasheet that came with your device.

To use it, simply:

```JavaScript
var sensor = require("DS18B20").connect(A1);
print(sensor.getTemp());
```

And the current temperature will be displayed:

```JavaScript
=27.625
```
