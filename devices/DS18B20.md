DS18B20 Temperature Sensor
=======================

* KEYWORDS: OneWire,DS18B20,Temperature,Sensor

One of the most common 1-Wire devices is the DS18B20 thermometer. Below is a very simple driver for it:

```JavaScript
OneWire.prototype.getTemp = function (addr) { 
  this.reset();
  this.select(addr); 
  this.write(0x44, true); // convert
  this.reset();
  this.select(addr);
  this.write(0xBE);                                    
  var temp = this.read() + (this.read()<<8);
  if (temp > 32767) temp -= 65536;
  return temp / 16.0;
}
```

To use it, connect the thermometer up - to 0v, 3.3v, and the data line to any free signal line of your Espruino device, with a 4.7k resistor between data and the 3.3v line. For this example I've chosen C14. 
 
Note: On the devices with cables, if you have Red, Yellow and Green wires then most likely they represent:
Green	 Ground
Red	 3.3v
Yellow	 Data
However please check the datasheet that came with your device.

 
Now initialise the OneWire driver:
```JavaScript
var ow = new OneWire(C14); 
```
 
And copy and paste in the temperature driver above.
 
Then scan for devices:
```JavaScript
ow.search()
```
This will return an array containing all devices. You'll get something like:
```JavaScript
=[-8574853671160008920]
```
 
Then simply copy this number into parameters of the getTemp function. For instance:
```JavaScript
ow.getTemp(-8574853671160008920)
```
 
And the current temperature will be displayed:
```JavaScript
=27.625
```
 
Note that you could also save copying the address by saving it to a variable:
 
```JavaScript
var addr = ow.search()[0];
ow.getTemp(addr);
```
