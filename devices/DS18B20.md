![DS18B20 Cable](cable.jpg)

One of the most common 1-Wire devices is the DS18B20 thermometer. Use the [[DS18B20.js]] module for it.

**Note:** The DS18B20 comes in both a cable, an SMD, and a transistor-style package. We're only covering the cable here, but for others see the [Datasheet](/datasheets/DS18B20.pdf).

Connect it up - to 0v, 3.3v, and the data line to any free signal line of your Espruino device, with a 4.7k resistor between data and the 3.3v line. 
 
| Colour #1 | Colour #2 | Espruino   |
| --------- | --------- | ---------- |
| Black     | Green     | GND        |
| Red       | Red       | 3.3v       | 
| White     | Yellow    | Any GPIO   |

To use it (assuming you connected to pin A1), simply:

```JavaScript
var sensor = require("DS18B20").connect(A1);
print(sensor.getTemp());
```

And the current temperature will be displayed:

```JavaScript
=27.625
```
