DS18B20 Temperature Sensor

![DS18B20 Cable](cable.jpg)

One of the most common 1-Wire devices is the DS18B20 thermometer. Use the [[DS18B20.js]] module for it.

**Note:** The DS18B20 comes in both a cable, an SMD, and a transistor-style package. We're only covering the cable here, but for others see the [Datasheet](/datasheets/DS18B20.pdf).

Connect it up - to 0v, 3.3v, and the data line to any free signal line of your Espruino device, with a 4.7k resistor between data and the 3.3v line. There seem to be two types of cabled sensor, and each has differently coloured wires. Both are covered below:

| Sensor type 1 | Sensor type 2 | Espruino   | 4.7k Resistor |
| --------- | --------- | ---------- | ------------- |
| Black     | Green     | GND        |               |
| Red       | Red       | 3.3v       | 1st wire      |
| White     | Yellow    | Any GPIO   | 2nd wire      |

To use it (assuming you connected to pin A1), simply:

```JavaScript
var ow = new OneWire(A1);
var sensor = require("DS18B20").connect(ow);
setInterval(function() {
  console.log(sensor.getTemp());
}, 1000);
```

And the current temperature will be displayed every second. Note that the first time getTemp is called, an incorrect temperature may be returned.

```JavaScript
=27.625
```

Multiple sensors
---------------

The DS18B20 communicates over a 1-Wire bus, which allows connecting multiple thermometers on the same data line.

To create an array containing three sensors, simply:

```JavaScript
var ow = new OneWire(A1);
var sensor1 = require("DS18B20").connect(ow, 0);
var sensor2 = require("DS18B20").connect(ow, 1);
var sensor3 = require("DS18B20").connect(ow, 2);
var sensors = [sensor1, sensor2, sensor3];
```

Alternatively, you can create the same array with a little help of the Array.map() function:

```JavaScript
var sensors = ow.search().map(function (device) {
  return require("DS18B20").connect(ow, device);
});
```

Now make a function that will be called repeatedly by Espruino:

```JavaScript
setInterval(function() {
  sensors.forEach(function (sensor, index) {
    console.log(index + ": " + sensor.getTemp());
  });
}, 1000);
```

And the current temperature of each sensor will be displayed every second:

```JavaScript
0: 25.3125
1: 21.0625
2: 24.1875
```
