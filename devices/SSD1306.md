![Crius C0-16 OLED Display](module.jpg)

This is the monochome OLED display driver found in the Crius C0-16 display (128x64), or the hexTronic HO-01.

It draws around 2.5mA (although this will increase if more pixels are lit).

Support is included in the [[SSD1306.js]] module, using the [[Graphics]] library.

These displays come in a few forms, allowing communication via 4-wire SPI (with a D/C pin), 3-wire SPI, and I2C.

SPI
---

SPI 3-wire isn't supported by this driver, only 4-wire is.

| OLED pin  | Example pin on Espruino Board |
|-----------|-------------------------------|
| GND       | GND |
| VCC       | 3.3/vBat |
| D0/SCK    | B5 |
| D1/MOSI   | B6 |
| DC        | A8 |
| RST       | B7 |

The example below uses software SPI, so you can connect to whatever pins you require. 
In fact the display draws so little power that VCC can be powered directly from one 
of Espruino's GPIO pins.

I2C
---

Just wire up as follows:

| OLED pin | Pin type | Example pin on Espruino Board |
|---------|----------|-------------------------------|
|  1 (black)   | GND      | GND |
|  2 (red) | 5V    | 3.3/vBat |
|  3 (yellow) | SDA (D1)    | B7 |
|  4 (green) | SCL (D0)  | B6 |

If you get I2C timeouts, you may need to add two 4.7 kOhm resistors, one from SDA to 3.3v, and one from SCL to 3.3v. 

If you keep getting timeouts it might be because your display is set to the 3-wire SPI mode. To fix this, you can carefully short out pins 19 and 20 on the ribbon cable on the back of your module with a blob of solder.

Software
-------

```
function start(){
 // write some text
 g.drawString("Hello World!",2,2);
 // write to the screen
 g.flip(); 
}

// I2C
I2C1.setup({scl:B6,sda:B7});
var g = exports.connect(I2C1, start);

// SPI
var s = new SPI();
s.setup({mosi: B6 /* D1 */, sck:B5 /* D0 */});
var g = exports.connectSPI(s, A8 /* DC */, B7 /* RST - can leave as undefined */, start);
```


**Note:** This module uses a double buffer, which means you need to call ```g.flip()``` before any changes take effect.
