![Crius C0-16 OLED Display](module.jpg)

This is the monochome OLED display driver found in the Crius C0-16 display (128x64), or the hexTronic HO-01.

It draws around 2.5mA (although this will increase if more pixels are lit).

Support is included in the [[SSD1306.js]] module, using the [[Graphics]] library.

Just wire up as follows:

| OLED pin | Pin type | Example pin on Espruino Board |
|---------|----------|-------------------------------|
|  1 (black)   | GND      | GND |
|  2 (red) | 5V    | 3.3/vBat |
|  3 (yellow) | SDA     | B7 |
|  4 (green) | SCL  | B6 |

Connection Issues
---------------

If you get I2C timeouts, you may need to add two 4.7 kOhm resistors, one from SDA to 3.3v, and one from SCL to 3.3v.

The SSD1306 driver also has several different modes (SPI 3-wire, SPI 4-wire, I2C, and others) that are set depending on the voltage on certain pins. Some OLED modules don't set the interface mode to I2C, but instead just leave it in SPI mode which will also cause I2C timeouts. To fix this, you can carefully short out pins 19 and 20 on the ribbon cable on the back of your module with a blob of solder.


Software
-------

```
I2C1.setup({scl:B6,sda:B7});
var g = require("SSD1306").connect(I2C1, function(){
   // write some text
   g.drawString("Hello World!",2,2);
   // write to the screen
   g.flip(); 
 }
);
```

Note:

* This module uses a double buffer, which means you need to call ```g.flip()``` before any changes take effect.
