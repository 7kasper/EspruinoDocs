MPL115A2, I2C digital barometer and temperature sensor
=====================

* KEYWORDS: Module,mpl115a2,barometer,temperature,pressure,i2c,kPa,celsius

MPL115A2 is a miniature I2C Digital Barometer for low cost applications. Each device is individually calibrated and produces air pressure data in kPa and temperature in Celsius. Use the [MPL115A2](/modules/MPL115A2.js) module for it.

You can wire this up as follows:

| Device Pin | Espruino |
| ---------- | -------- |
| GND        | GND      |
| VDD        | 3.3      |
| SCL        | B6       |
| SDA        | B7       |

You will need 4.7k - 10k pull-up resistors for the I2C signal wires. If you use the breakout board from [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/products/992) things are super-easy as 10k pull-up resistors are included. Just connect the wires.

How to use the module:

```js
I2C1.setup({scl:B6,sda:B7});
var device = require('MPL115A2').connect(I2C1);

device.getData(function(data) {
   console.log(data); // Data is an object like this: {t:22.51, p: 101.68}, where t is in C and p is in kPa
});
```
