The TMP117 is a high-precision digital temperature
sensor. The TMP117 provides a 16-bit
temperature result with a resolution of 0.0078°C and
an accuracy of up to ±0.1°C across the temperature
range of -20°C to 50°C with no calibration.

In Espruino it is supported with the [[TMP117.js]] module.

Wiring
------

The module doesn't currently support using the Alert output, so
all you need to do is connect GND, VCC (3.3v) and SDA/SCL I2C
pins to available data pins.

Connect `ADD0` to GND to ensure an address of `0x48`


Software
--------

```JavaScript
var i = new I2C();
i.setup({sda:YOUR_SDA_PIN, scl:YOUR_SCL_PIN});
var t = require("TMP117").connect(i);
t.getTemp(function(tmp) {
  console.log("Temp is "+tmp+" degrees C");
});
```
