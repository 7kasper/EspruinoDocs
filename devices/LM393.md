LM339/393 Comparator (set watch on analog voltage)
=====================

* KEYWORDS: MOSFET,Transitor

One limitation of most microcontrollers, including those used in the Espruino board, is that there is no way to set an watch/interrupt based on the analog value of a pin. Without external components, all you can do is periodically poll the pin with analogRead(). This means that the Espruino must wake periodically if in sleep mode to save power, and if the Espruino must respond within a few seconds, the polling would need to be so frequent that sleep could not be used at all. 

Luckily, there is a readily available and inexpensive solution in the form of LM393/339 dual/quad comparators. Each of the 2 or 4 comparators on these parts has an input, an inverting input, and an output. If the input is higher than the inverting input, the output will be pulled low. Now, if you want to trigger a callback when the voltage goes above a certain voltage, you need only connect one of the inputs to a reference voltage, and the output to a pin on the Espruino, and setWatch() on that. 

Considerations

* This is an open collector device - so be sure to use pinMode(pin,"input-pullup") to use the pullup on the 
* For accurate results, at least one of the inputs must be within the "common mode voltage range", between 0V and Vcc-1.5v. Therefore, you should power it from Bat, not +3.3v.
