I2C LCD Module LCD1602
===================

* KEYWORDS: LCD,Display,I2C,LCD1602,PCF8574

This module is just a standard 1602 dot-matrix LCD Display with a PCF8574 8 bit IO expander attached to it. To use it, you can use the same basic code that you use when interfacing to the LCD with a parallel interface - you only have to change the part that writes values to it.

So just copy and paste the following code - this is a standard constructor that initialises the display, and a function to write a byte of data to the LCD display:

```JavaScript
function LCD(i2c) {
 this.i2c = i2c;
 this.write(0x33,1);
 this.write(0x32,1);
 this.write(0x28,1);
 this.write(0x0C,1);
 this.write(0x06,1);
 this.write(0x01,1);
}
LCD.prototype.write = function(x, c) {
  var a = (x&0xF0) |8| ((c==undefined)?1:0);
  var b = ((x<<4)&0xF0) |8| ((c==undefined)?1:0);
  this.i2c.writeTo(0x27, [a,a,a|4,a|4,a,a,b,b,b|4,b|4,b,b]);
}; 
```

Then, go to the LCD Driver webpage and copy out the LCD driver code apart from the first two definitions (for LCD and LCD.prototype.write).


Now, all you need to do is set up I2C, instantiate the LCD class, and use it!

```JavaScript
I2C1.setup({scl:B6, sda:B7});
var lcd = new LCD(I2C1);
lcd.print("Hello World!");
```

If you're just connecting your I2C module to an I2C port on your Espruino device, you'll need to add external pull-ups.

In the code above:

The value '4' that is ORed into the data is the enable bit. This needs to be pulsed for the LCD display to be able to read the data that we send. In order to pulse it for long enough, we send the data twice - as this is faster than having two separate I2C transactions and a delay.
The value '8' is ORed into all the data sent down I2C - this is the bit that controls the backlight. If you want to change the state of the backlight, you could modify it.
