The IS31FL3731 is a compact LED driver for up to 144 single LEDs.

It can be used as follows:

```
// Call at boot time
var i2c = new I2C();
i2c.setup({sda:D27,scl:D28}); // use the I2C pins you're using here
g = require("IS31FL3731").connect(i2c);
// g is an instance of Graphics
g.drawString("Hi");
// Send the changes to the screen
g.flip();
```

`g` is an instance of the [[Graphics]] class that is 16 pixels wide, 9 pixels high,
and 8 bits per pixel (so it can output greyscale);
