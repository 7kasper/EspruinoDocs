([Datasheet](/datasheets/ULN2003.pdf)) and [product at RS Components](http://uk.rs-online.com/web/p/motor-driver-ics/0426229/)

The ULN2003 has 7 x 500mA outputs, but they can only pull down to 0v. This makes it great for powering relays, solenoids and stepper motors - but only useful for motors if you only need them to run in a single direction.

The ULN2003 comes in many different packages, but the SO16 package can be soldered directly onto Espruino's prototype area. It is also small enough that you can solder two ULN2003 chips on for a total of 14 powered outputs.

Connections
---------

![ULN2003 pinout](pinout.png)

With the writing on the IC the correct way around, Pin 1 is on the bottom left.

To use, simply connect as follows:

| Pin | Function | Connect To |
|-----|----------|------------|
| E | Emitter | Connect to Ground |
| 1-7 B | Transistor Base | Any logic pin on the Espruino board |
| 1-7 C | Transistor Collector | Your Motors/etc |
| COM | Common | Nothing, or other side of load being driven |

  **Note:** COM is connected to each output (1-7 C) via a diode. If you're driving inductive loads then you can connect it to the other side of the load being driven, and it will help to clamp the Back EMF generated when the load is turned off.

If you're soldering onto the board, we'd suggest for connect as follows:


![ULN2003 connections to Espruino](connections.png)

| ULN2003 | Espruino |
|---------|----------|
| 1 - 1B  | A2 |
| 2 - 2B  | A3 |
| 3 - 3B  | A6 |
| 4 - 4B  | A7 |
| 5 - 5B  | B0 |
| 6 - 6B  | B1 |
| 7 - 7B  | B10 |

That way, every output can have [[PWM]].

Software
-------

To use this, you just need to send a 1 or a 0 out of Espruino. If you've wired up as suggested, the simplest code to turn output 1 on is `digitalWrite(A2,1)`.

However with multiple outputs it's often easier to reference them by number:

```
var outputs = [A2,A3,A6,A7,B0,B1,B10];

digitalWrite(outputs[0],1); // output 0
digitalWrite(outputs[4],1); // output 3
```

You can also use analogWrite (using [[PWM]]) to turn an output on for half of the time:

```
var outputs = [A2,A3,A6,A7,B0,B1,B10];

analogWrite(outputs[1], 0.5, { freq: 100 }); // Turn output 2 on, 50% of the time, at 100 Hz
```
