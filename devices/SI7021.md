SI7021(-A20) I2C Temperature and Humidity Sensor
=====================

* KEYWORDS: Temperature,Humidity,I2C

A bit about my module. Use the [SI7021](/modules/SI7021.js) ([About Modules](/Modules)) module for it.
Si7021(-A20) is a I2C Humidity and Temperature sensor by Silicon Labs.
Default temperature unit of measure (by factory) is Celsius.

- Breakout Board is purchasable at: [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3251).
- Datasheet: [Silabs](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/data-sheets/Si7021-A20.pdf).

This module is interfacing all the commands available on the Si7021(-A20) module.
Temperature and Humidity formulas are provided by the Sensor's Datasheet.

You can wire this up as follows:

| Device Pin | Espruino |
| ---------- | -------- |
| 1 (GND)    | GND      |
| 2 (VCC)    | 3.3      |
| 3 (SDA)    | B9       |
| 4 (DCL)    | B8       |

Put `4K7Ohm pull up resistors to both SDA and SCL

How to use my module:

```
  var foo = require("SI7021").connect(I2C1);
  foo.readTemperature();
```
