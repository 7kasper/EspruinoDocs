Support is provided in Espruino by the [[ESP8266.js]] module.

Different versions of the ESP8266 firmware communicate at different baud rates and have subtly different commands. The code in Espruino is designed and tested with version `0018000902-AI03` (shipped with Espruino Pico KickStarter boards). You can check with the `AT+GMR` command or using `wifi.getVersion(print)` on this Module.

Espruino Pico Shim
----------------

![ESP8266 shim](shim2.jpg)

![ESP8266 shim](shim.jpg)

The Shim available for the Espruino Pico helps to adapt the ESP8266 to fit onto the Pico, while still keeping all of the IOs intact. Please see the video below:

[[http://youtu.be/zqI_g-T0HP0]]

If your Pico had pins pre-installed, you will need to cut the black plastic away from the last 3 pins in order to fit the shim.

Wiring Up
--------

![ESP8266 pinout](pinout.png)

(viewed from component side)

| Pin  | Espruino | Pico | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| URXD | C10      | A2 | Serial3 / Serial4      |
| VCC  | 3.3      | 3.3 | You'll need an extra 3.3v regulator when using this on an Original [Espruino board](/EspruinoBoard] as it can't supply enough power. The [[Pico]] is fine without though. |
| GPIO0  | Not Connected    | |      |
| RST    | Not Connected    | |      |
| GPIO2  | Not Connected    | |      |
| CH_PD  | 3.3    | | Boot mode - must be 1 to enable WiFi      |
| GND  | GND      | GND |      |
| UTXD | C11      | A3 | Serial3 / Serial4      |

The board communicates at 9600 8 baud, 1 stop bit, no parity. *However some versions use 115200 baud*.

To add a voltage regulator, we'd suggest you wire up an LD1117AV33 as follows:

If you're using the 'Shim' for the Espruino Pico you needn't worry about this - just solder the shim to the Espruino and the ESP8266.

Software
-------

```
Serial4.setup(115200, { rx: C11, tx : C10 });
var wifi = require("ESP8266").connect(Serial4, function() {
  console.log("Connecting to WiFi");
  wifi.connect("WiFi_Name","WPA2_Key", function() {
    console.log("Connected");
    require("http").get("http://192.168.1.50", function(res) {
      console.log("Response: ",res);
      res.on('data', function(d) {
        console.log("--->"+d);
      });
    });
  });
});
```

or:

```
Serial2.setup(9600, { rx: A3, tx : A2 });
var wifi = require("ESP8266").connect(Serial2, function() {
 ...
}
```

for the Espruino Pico.

Apart from the initialisation (`require("ESP8266").connect(...)`) the networking code should be identical to that described on the [[Internet]] page.

Gotchas
------

* You can only have a maximum of 5 concurrent TCP/IP clients
* You can only have one TCP/IP server, and while it is active you *can not have any clients*
* You'll need to have an up to date firmware on the ESP8266 (v0.924 or later). See some of the links below for details.
