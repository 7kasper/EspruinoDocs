Support is provided in Espruino by the [[ESP8266WiFi.js]] and [[ESP8266WiFi_0v25.js]] modules.

Different versions of the ESP8266 firmware communicate at different baud rates and have subtly different commands - make sure you use the correct code for the version that you have.

Espruino Pico Shim
----------------

![ESP8266 shim](ESP8266/shim2.jpg)

![ESP8266 shim](ESP8266/shim.jpg)

The [Shim](/Shims) available for the Espruino Pico helps to adapt the ESP8266 to fit onto the Pico, while still keeping all of the IOs intact. Please see the video below:

[[http://youtu.be/zqI_g-T0HP0]]

If your Pico had pins pre-installed, you will need to cut the black plastic away from the last 3 pins in order to fit the [shim](/Shims).

Wiring Up
--------

![ESP8266 pinout](ESP8266/pinout.png)

(viewed from component side)

| Pin   | Espruino | Pico | Notes |
|-------|----------|------|-------|
| URXD  | C10  (Serial3 / Serial4) | A2 (Serial2) | |
| VCC   | 3.3      | 3.3 | You'll need an extra 3.3v regulator when using this on an original [Espruino board](/EspruinoBoard) as it can't supply enough power. The [[Pico]] is fine without though. |
| GPIO0 | Not Connected | |      |
| RST   | Not Connected | |      |
| GPIO2 | Not Connected | |      |
| CH_PD | 3.3      |     | Boot mode - must be 1 to enable WiFi      |
| GND   | GND      | GND |      |
| UTXD  | C11 (Serial3 / Serial4) | A3 (Serial2)  |  |

**Note:** If you're not using the ESP8266 shim, you will almost certainly need to add at least a 10uF capacitor between `GND` and the ESP8266's `3.3v` line to get it to work reliably.

The board communicates at 9600 8 baud, 1 stop bit, no parity. *However some versions use 115200 baud*.

To add a voltage regulator (needed on the original [Espruino board](/EspruinoBoard)), we'd suggest you wire up an LD1117AV33 as follows:

![LD1117AV33  connections](ESP8266/vreg.png)

If you're using the [Shim](/Shims) for the Espruino Pico you needn't worry about this - just solder the [Shim](/Shims) to the Espruino and the ESP8266.


Firmware Versions
---------------

To quickly test which firmware you have and that you have a connection, paste the following code into the left hand side of the Web IDE (making sure you use the pins and Serial port from the table above):

```
function test(serial, baud, pins) {
  serial.removeAllListeners();
  var l="";
  serial.on('data', function(d) {l+=d});
  serial.setup(baud, pins);
  serial.write("AT+GMR\r\n");
  setTimeout(function(){console.log(JSON.stringify(l));},1000);
}
test(Serial2, 9600, { rx: A3, tx : A2 });
```

Hopefully you'll see something like `"AT+GMR\r\r\n0018000902-AI03\r\n\r\nOK\r\n"`, showing that `0018000902-AI03` is the version number.

If this doesn't work, or returns garbage, try running `test` again using `115200` instead of `9600`, and if that doesn't work, try `57600`. If you don't get any response, check that the red power LED on the ESP8266 is lit, and that you have TX and RX wires the correct way around.

| Tested Version    | Baud Rate  | Module Name | Notes |
|-------------------|------------|-------------|-------|
| `0018000902-AI03` | 9600       |`ESP8266WiFi` | This was the version sent on boards that came with the Espruino Pico KickStarter. It's quite old now, and is known have quite a few bugs. ([download firmware](/files/ESP8266_AT_V00180902_04.bin))  |
| `0.25.0.0`        | 115200 |`ESP8266WiFi_0v25` | This is a newer, more reliable version ([download firmware](/files/ESP8266_AT25-SDK112-512k.bin)) |

If you don't have the `0018000902-AI03` firmware version, make sure you change the baud rate and Module Name in the code examples below.

Updating ESP8266 Firmware
----------------------

This is currently quite difficult, and you'll need a USB-TTL converter connected to the ESP8266's RX and TX, and to short GPIO2 to 3.3v when you first apply power to your ESP8266.

You can use the [esptool Python command-line tool](https://github.com/themadinventor/esptool) like this: `./esptool.py write_flash 0 binary_file.bin`

Or [there is a tutorial using a Windows program on Instructables](http://www.instructables.com/id/Intro-Esp-8266-firmware-update/)

Software
-------

Just use something like the following for the Espruino Pico:

```
Serial2.setup(9600, { rx: A3, tx : A2 });
var wifi = require("ESP8266WiFi").connect(Serial2, function(err) {
  if (err) throw err;
  wifi.reset(function(err) {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log("Connecting to WiFi");
    wifi.connect("WiFi_Name","WPA2_Key", function(err) {
      if (err) throw err;
      console.log("Connected");
      // Now you can do something, like an HTTP request
      require("http").get("http://www.pur3.co.uk/hello.txt", function(res) {
        console.log("Response: ",res);
        res.on('data', function(d) {
          console.log("--->"+d);
        });
      });
    });
  });
});
```

or the following for the original Espruino board:

```
Serial4.setup(115200, { rx: C11, tx : C10 });
var wifi = require("ESP8266WiFi").connect(Serial4, function() {
 ...
}
```

**Note:** you don't absolutely have to call `reset()`, but in order to get a reliable connection we'd recommend it.

Apart from the initialisation (`require("ESP8266WiFi").connect(...)`) the networking code should be identical to that described on the [[Internet]] page.

Gotchas
------

* You can only have a maximum of 5 concurrent TCP/IP clients
* You can only have one TCP/IP server, and while it is active you *can not have any clients*
* You'll need to have the correct firmware on the ESP8266 (see above). See some of the links below for details on how to modify your firmware.

Reference
--------

`wifi.at`

The AT command handler - use this to send your own AT commands to the ESP8266. 
You can also call `wifi.at.debug()` to return debugging information and to turn
on debug messages.

`wifi.debug()`

Return information on open sockets and received data.

`wifi.init(function(err) { ... })`

Initialise WiFi settings - you shouldn't ever need to call this. The callback is called with `err==null` on success.

`wifi.reset(function(err) { ... });`

Reset the ESP8266 with `AT+RST`, also call `wifi.init`. The callback is called with `err==null` on success.

`wifi.getVersion(function(err, version) { ... });`

Call the callback with the version number reported back from the `AT+GMR` command. The callback is called with `err==null` on success.

`wifi.connect(ssid, key, function(err) { ... });`

Connect to the given access point. The callback is called with `err==null` on success.

`wifi.getAPs(function(err, aps) { ... });`

Call the callback with a list of access points, of the form `aps = [ { ssid, enc, signal_strength, mac_address } ]`.  The callback is called with `err==null` on success.

`wifi.getConnectedAP(function(err, ap) { ... });`

Call the callback with the name of the currently connected access point.  The callback is called with `err==null` on success.

`wifi.createAP(ssid, key, channel, enc, function(err) { ... })`

Create an access point with the given ssid, key, channel, and encoding. Encoding can be `0`, `undefined`, `"open"`, `"wep"`, `"wpa_psk"`, `"wpa2_psk"` or `"wpa_wpa2_psk"`.

See [the table on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WLAN_channels#Interference_concerns) for available channels. Channels 5 to 11 seem safe to use in virtually all countries. The function may fail if the supplied key is too short.

*Example:* `wifi.createAP("ESP123","HelloWorld",5,"wpa2_psk",print)`

`wifi.getIP(function(err, ip) { ... });`

Call the callback with the current IP address, as a String.  The callback is called with `err==null` on success.
