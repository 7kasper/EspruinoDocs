![ESP8266 module](module.jpg)

Support is provided in Espruino by the [[ESP8266WiFi.js]] module.

Different versions of the ESP8266 firmware communicate at different baud rates and have subtly different commands. The code in Espruino is designed and tested with version `0018000902-AI03` (shipped with Espruino Pico KickStarter boards). You can check with the `AT+GMR` command or using `wifi.getVersion(print)` on this Module.

Espruino Pico Shim
----------------

![ESP8266 shim](shim2.jpg)

![ESP8266 shim](shim.jpg)

The [Shim](/Shims) available for the Espruino Pico helps to adapt the ESP8266 to fit onto the Pico, while still keeping all of the IOs intact. Please see the video below:

[[http://youtu.be/zqI_g-T0HP0]]

If your Pico had pins pre-installed, you will need to cut the black plastic away from the last 3 pins in order to fit the [shim](/Shims).

Wiring Up
--------

![ESP8266 pinout](pinout.png)

(viewed from component side)

| Pin   | Espruino | Pico | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| URXD  | C10      | A2  | Serial3 / Serial4      |
| VCC   | 3.3      | 3.3 | You'll need an extra 3.3v regulator when using this on an original [Espruino board](/EspruinoBoard) as it can't supply enough power. The [[Pico]] is fine without though. |
| GPIO0 | Not Connected | |      |
| RST   | Not Connected | |      |
| GPIO2 | Not Connected | |      |
| CH_PD | 3.3      |     | Boot mode - must be 1 to enable WiFi      |
| GND   | GND      | GND |      |
| UTXD  | C11      | A3  | Serial3 / Serial4      |

The board communicates at 9600 8 baud, 1 stop bit, no parity. *However some versions use 115200 baud*.

To add a voltage regulator (needed on the original [Espruino board](/EspruinoBoard)), we'd suggest you wire up an LD1117AV33 as follows:

![LD1117AV33  connections](vreg.png)

If you're using the [Shim](/Shims) for the Espruino Pico you needn't worry about this - just solder the [Shim](/Shims) to the Espruino and the ESP8266.

Software
-------

Just use something like the following for the Espruino Pico:

```
Serial2.setup(9600, { rx: A3, tx : A2 });
var wifi = require("ESP8266WiFi").connect(Serial2, function(err) {
  if (err) throw err;
  wifi.reset(function(err) {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log("Connecting to WiFi");
    wifi.connect("WiFi_Name","WPA2_Key", function(err) {
      if (err) throw err;
      console.log("Connected");
      // Now you can do something, like an HTTP request
      require("http").get("http://www.pur3.co.uk/hello.txt", function(res) {
        console.log("Response: ",res);
        res.on('data', function(d) {
          console.log("--->"+d);
        });
      });
    });
  });
});
```

or the following for the original Espruino board:

```
Serial4.setup(115200, { rx: C11, tx : C10 });
var wifi = require("ESP8266WiFi").connect(Serial4, function() {
 ...
}
```

**Note:** you don't absolutely have to call `reset()`, but in order to get a reliable connection we'd recommend it.

Apart from the initialisation (`require("ESP8266WiFi").connect(...)`) the networking code should be identical to that described on the [[Internet]] page.

Gotchas
------

* You can only have a maximum of 5 concurrent TCP/IP clients
* You can only have one TCP/IP server, and while it is active you *can not have any clients*
* You'll need to have the correct firmware on the ESP8266 (see above). See some of the links below for details on how to modify your firmware.

Reference
--------

`wifi.at`

The AT command handler - use this to send your own AT commands to the ESP8266. 
You can also call `wifi.at.debug()` to return debugging information and to turn
on debug messages.

`wifi.debug()`

Return information on open sockets and received data.

`wifi.init(function(err) { ... })`

Initialise WiFi settings - you shouldn't ever need to call this. The callback is called with `err==null` on success.

`wifi.reset(function(err) { ... });`

Reset the ESP8266 with `AT+RST`, also call `wifi.init`. The callback is called with `err==null` on success.

`wifi.getVersion(function(err, version) { ... });`

Call the callback with the version number reported back from the `AT+GMR` command. The callback is called with `err==null` on success.

`wifi.connect(ssid, key, function(err) { ... });`

Connect to the given access point. The callback is called with `err==null` on success.

`wifi.getAPs(function(err, aps) { ... });`

Call the callback with a list of access points, of the form `aps = [ { ssid, enc, signal_strength, mac_address } ]`.  The callback is called with `err==null` on success.

`wifi.getConnectedAP(function(err, ap) { ... });`

Call the callback with the name of the currently connected access point.  The callback is called with `err==null` on success.

`wifi.createAP(ssid, key, channel, enc, function(err) { ... })`

Create an access point with the given ssid, key, channel, and encoding. Encoding can be `0`, `undefined`, `"open"`, `"wep"`, `"wpa_psk"`, `"wpa2_psk"` or `"wpa_wpa2_psk"`.

See [the table on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WLAN_channels#Interference_concerns) for available channels. Channels 5 to 11 seem safe to use in virtually all countries.

`wifi.getIP(function(err, ip) { ... });`

Call the callback with the current IP address, as a String.  The callback is called with `err==null` on success.
