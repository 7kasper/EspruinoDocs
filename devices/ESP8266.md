Important
--------

**Development is in progress.** There is currently no working support for this module on any boards, on any version of Espruino.

Currently we will only be supporting the *new version of the module*. The new version has a power LED between the aerial and the 8 legged IC that is not present on older boards.

Wiring Up
--------

![ESP8266 pinout](pinout.png)

(viewed from component side)

| Pin  | Espruino | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| URXD | C10      | Serial3 / Serial4      |
| VCC  | 3.3      | You'll need an extra 3.3v regulator for this.<br/>The Espruino board can't supply enough power. |
| GPIO0  | Not Connected    |       |
| RST    | Not Connected    |       |
| GPIO2  | Not Connected    |       |
| CH_PD  | 3.3    | Boot mode - must be 1 to enable WiFi      |
| GND  | GND      |       |
| UTXD | C11      | Serial3 / Serial4      |

The board communicates at 115200 8 baud, 1 stop bit, no parity.

To add a voltage regulator, we'd suggest you wire up an LD1117AV33 as follows:

![LD1117AV33  connections](vreg.png)


Software
-------

```
Serial4.setup(115200, { rx: C11, tx : C10 });
var wifi = require("ESP8266").connect(Serial4, function() {
  wifi.connect("WiFi_Name","WPA2_Key", function() {
    console.log("Waiting 10 secs for connect...");
    setTimeout(function() {
      require("http").get("http://192.168.1.50", function(res) {
  
      });
    }, 10000);
  });
});
```
