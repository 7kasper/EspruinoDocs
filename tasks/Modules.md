Modules

* KEYWORDS: Modules,Libraries

In Espruino, Modules are bits of pre-written code (libraries) that perform common tasks, such as interfacing to different bits of hardware.

**MODULES ARE CURRENTLY A WORK IN PROGRESS**

Copying the module into a directory called 'node_modules' on an SD card and inserting it into Espruino will allow you to write ``` require('modulename') ``` in order to use it. We're currently working on a solution that will allow the Web IDE to automatically load modules without an SD card, but this is not yet implemented.
